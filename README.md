LIRI.JS IS A GREAT WAY TO GET INFORMATION ABOUT MOVIES, CONCERTS, AND SONGS!

How does this work? Quite simple. 

First, as a user you put in a two-part command. The first part identifies what are you searching. You have the following four options: 
    concert-this        <--- Use this command if you are interested in looking up musical concerts coming your way.
    spotify-this-song   <--- Use this command if you are interested in looking up a song by the song's name.
    movie-this          <--- Use this command if you are interested in looking up a movie.
    do-what-it-says     <--- Use this command for a surpirse command that is pre-loaded to a text files. 
After you type your command, in double quotations write down the term you are searching. 
The following are examples appropriate commands you can type into your terminal: 
    concert-this "Lumineers"
    spotify-this-song "I Want It That Way"
    movie-this "Roman Holiday" 
    do-what-it-says
The program will gather information from IMDB, Spotify, or BandsInTown to get you a baisc grasp on your topic.
